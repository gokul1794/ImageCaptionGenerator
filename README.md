# Image-captioning---DSP
Implement image Captioning using deep learning

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Image-captioning---DSP.git/master)

TO DO:
- [x] Dataloaders
- [ ] Model Arch
- [ ] Training Loop
- [ ] Inference

The Caption_prep.py file reuses code from 'https://github.com/Raman-Raje/ImageCaptioning/blob/master/dataset%20preperation.ipynb'

Instructions to run

To run locally

1.Place the zip files into the same directory as your code

2. Make sure to use 'incep_pkl.zip' while running the notebook 'Inception_caption' and 'vgg_pkl.zip' for running the 'Vgg_caption' file

3. Use the first cell to unzip and load the files and then comment the same in subsequent runs

4. No other specific instruction required

To run on colab
1. Makke sure to upload the appropriate zip files and run as usual
